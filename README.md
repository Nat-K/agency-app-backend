# Description
This is the back end of a full-stack (MERN) application. It is written with Express, with use of native Node functionality for file management. Auth is handled with JWT to the front-end. A complete REST api feeds the front end application and in production this acts as the file server.
The front end app can be found here: https://github.com/Nat-K/agency-app

## Todo
